Ferguson Demographics
=====================

This data shows the 177 communities of at least 5,000 population that were at least 50% white in 1990 and at least 50% black in 2010, according to the Census Bureau. Population and racial/ethnic percentages are from the 1990, 2000 and 2010 censuses. Median household income is from the 2012 ACS 5-year estimates. Columns beginning with `pernh` indicate percent non-Hispanic population, so `pernhblack2000` means percent non-Hispanic black in 2000. `HHI` stands for household income.
