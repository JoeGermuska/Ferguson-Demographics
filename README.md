Ferguson Demographics
=====================

Census Bureau data from an analysis performed for The Upshot by [Andrew Beveridge](https://www.socialexplorer.com/Andy-Beveridge), a sociology professor at Queens College, showing that there are 117 communities of 5,000 or more people in the United States that, like Ferguson, Mo., were over 50 percent white in 1990 and shifted to over 50 percent black in 2010. Columns beginning with `pernh` indicate percent non-Hispanic population, so `pernhblack2000` means percent non-Hispanic black in 2000. `HHI` stands for household income.
